I am a second year doctoral student from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes matrix analysis (e.g., Hadamard Conjecture, Macus-de Oliveira Conjecture), geometry of polynomials (e.g., Sendov Conjecture, Borcea’s Variance Conjecture, Smale's Mean Value Conjecture). 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Minghua Lin](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/mh.lin)  from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an Jiaotong University.
