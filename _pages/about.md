I am a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the  [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/),  [Xi’an Jiaotong University, China](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/),  under the supervision of  [Prof. Minghua Lin](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/mh.lin) and a joint Ph.D. student at the [Department of Analysis, Bolyai Institute](https://www.math.u-szeged.hu/analysis/),  [University of Szeged, Hungary](https://u-szeged.hu/),  under the supervision of  [Prof. Lajos Molnár](https://www.math.u-szeged.hu/~molnarl/).


My research interests lie in functional analysis, operator theory,  and geometry of polynomials. More specifically, I study  *transformations on operator algebras*,  *function algebras*, and *quantum structures*,  with a focus on *preserver problems*,  *local and nonlinear transformations*,  *matrix inequalities* and *value distribution problems of polynomials*.
